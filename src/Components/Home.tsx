            Heartview is a cutting-edge application that harnesses the power of Machine Learning (ML) to predict the
            likelihood of heart disease. By analyzing a comprehensive set of medical parameters, our advanced model
            provides you with a probability assessment of heart disease presence.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Our goal is to empower you with knowledge about your heart health, enabling early awareness and proactive
            healthcare decisions. However, it's crucial to understand that this tool is designed for preliminary
            screening and should not replace professional medical advice.
